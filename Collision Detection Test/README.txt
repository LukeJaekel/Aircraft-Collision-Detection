Whilst utilising my knowledge in audio as well as programming, this 
project integrates a basic alert system in which an alarm will trigger 
whilst two aircraft objects are within close proximity. I built this 
project to show how audio can be implemented for ATC training demonstration 
purposes. I plan on adding to this program by incorporating altitude in order 
to improve its accuracy.

USAGE:
Provided that pygame is installed, run the python file.

Use WASD for movement of top-side plane
Use arrow keys for movement of bottom-side plane
